> A large proportion of software developers' time is spent on reading and understanding existing code artifacts (such as APIs). I've contributed to a website that gathers research papers concerning API usability (<http://apiusability.org>{:target="_blank"}).
>
> I've worked in approaches related to API learning, both in the perspective of enriching APIs themselves as well as building up API usage support from existing code (machine learning).

## Dacite <a href="https://github.com/andre-santos-pt/dacite"><i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i></a>
A technique to annotate APIs with design decisions (mostly pertaining to design patterns), in order to facilitate API discoverability and learning with enhanced IDE code completion.

{% include pub topic="Dacite" papers="journals/jss/SantosM17" %}Dacite stands for *Design Annotations for Complementing Interfaces Targeting Effectiveness*. In collaboration with the [Natural Programming Project](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/dacite.html){:target="_blank"} (CMU).

## APISTA <a href="https://github.com/andre-santos-pt/apista"><i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i></a>
A technique to learn API sentences from existing code bases (using Markov models), in order to provide code completion in terms of the possible next instructions to write.

{% include pub topic="APISTA" papers="journals/jss/SantosPSR17" %} APISTA stands for *API Sentence Token Assistance*, whereas in Portuguese “a pista” means *"the clue"*.
